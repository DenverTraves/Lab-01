        <h2>22 year old white boy gamer</h2>

        <p>Born febuary 2000, the young Denver started off problematic as he was blind for the first year of his life,
            not even attempting to walk because he was smart enough to know he would smack his face off something hard.
            <br>After acquiring glasses he learned to walk and <br> Going through preschool and elementry school
            became a breeze as i was so smart with it all, except english. English was trash and horrible, but still
            graduated. <br>
        </p>
        </p> Going to highschool, grade 9 was a terrible year taking all academic courses and average 60s through
        everything. Math was especially hard since I had a shit teacher and ended up passing with a low 50%. <br> Onto
        grade 10 taking applied courses I learned to do better and better increasing my grades to finish off with 70-80%
        in some things. <br> Onto grade 11 and 12 was pretty much the same, I did well passed courses, took co op
        in a computer recycling centre called EDI in Orillia. Through that I learned more about computers, phones and
        components allowing me to extend knowledge for computers. <br>

        </p>
        </p> Post graduation I learned that computer programming was what career I wanted to take. I got a job working
        at Arby's and soon became a manager, I saved money for a few years and applied to the college. <br> I was then
        accepted and in the years between highschool and college I built about 5 computers for myself and a friend. <br>
         Building these computers I quickly learned troubleshooting problems I had with maintaining them.<br> 
        Some examples would be switching from amd to nvidia graphics drivers, screen display problems and overclocking.
        <br>
       
        <br> Finally im in college taking computer programming to excel my coding and maintnance abilities to make
        better money than retail/fast food.
